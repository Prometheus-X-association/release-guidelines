# Interoperability/integration testing process

## Introduction
Prometheus components are building blocks to a data space for education and skills.
They are made to work together, although they are built by different teams and different timelines.

## Tasks

### Defining Interoperability Scenarios

**Objective**: 
To identify, document, and prioritize scenarios where Component A and Component B need to interact, ensuring that they can effectively communicate, exchange data, and execute joint processes without any hindrance or error.
Scenarios are defined using the [K6](https://k6.io) scenario definitions.

**Steps**:

1. **Identification of Interaction Points**:
   - Detail every point where Component A communicates with Component B and vice versa.
   - Identify data exchange formats, protocols, and APIs that the two components use for this communication.

2. **Listing Possible Scenarios**:
   - Based on the interaction points, list all possible scenarios where the two components need to work together. For instance, a scenario might be "A user asks Component A to sends a data request to Component B on its behalf and expects a response within 2 seconds."

3. **Detailing Scenario Specifications**:
   - For each identified scenario, provide a detailed specification. This should include:
     - Input conditions: What needs to be true or present for this scenario to initiate?
     - Actions: What actions are undertaken during this scenario? This could involve data requests, data processing, or other joint actions.
     - Expected outcome: What is the desired result or output of the scenario?
     - Error conditions: What are potential error conditions or failure points in the scenario?

4. **Stakeholder Review**:
   - Engage with stakeholders to validate the relevance and importance of each scenario. They might provide insights into real-world situations or use cases that were initially overlooked.

5. **Prioritization**:
   - Once all scenarios are detailed and reviewed, prioritize them based on factors like frequency of occurrence, importance to end-users, risk levels if the scenario fails, etc.
   - This prioritization will guide the testing efforts, ensuring that the most critical interoperability scenarios are addressed first.

**Outcome**:
A comprehensive list of interoperability scenarios between Component A and Component B, each detailed with its specifications and prioritized based on its relevance and importance. This will serve as a foundational document for the subsequent testing efforts, ensuring that when the components are deployed in a real-world environment, they will interact seamlessly.

**Process**
- Workshop - 1 hour between component leaders and stakeholders


### Defining Success Metrics

**Objective**: 
To establish measurable criteria that will indicate the successful interoperability between Component A and Component B. These metrics serve as benchmarks to evaluate the effectiveness, efficiency, and reliability of the components' interaction.

**Steps**:

1. **Review Interoperability Scenarios**:
   - Revisit the defined interoperability scenarios between Component A and Component B. Each scenario will likely have its own unique success metrics.

2. **Determine Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**:
   - Identify KPIs that will signify successful interoperability. Examples include:
     - **Response Time**: The time it takes for Component B to respond to a request from Component A.
     - **Data Accuracy**: Ensuring the data exchanged between the components is accurate and consistent.
     - **Uptime/Availability**: The percentage of time both components are operational and can communicate without issues.

3. **Set Thresholds and Benchmarks**:
   - For each KPI, define a specific threshold or benchmark that will indicate success. For example:
     - Response Time should be less than 2 seconds 95% of the time.
     - Data Accuracy should be 99.9%.
     - Uptime should be 99.5%.

4. **Consider Edge Cases and Exception Handling**:
   - Define success metrics for how the components handle exceptions or unexpected events. For example, how quickly an error is resolved or how informative and accurate error messages are.

5. **Stakeholder Review**:
   - Engage with stakeholders to ensure that the defined success metrics align with organizational goals and end-user expectations. Adjust metrics based on their feedback and insights.

6. **Documentation**:
   - Document all success metrics, including their definitions, thresholds, and benchmarks. This document will guide testing and evaluation processes.

**Outcome**:
A well-documented set of success metrics that provide clear and measurable criteria for evaluating the interoperability between Component A and Component B. These metrics ensure that the components not only interact but do so in a way that meets or exceeds the desired levels of performance, reliability, and user satisfaction.

**Process**
- Asynchronous communication between component leads and stakeholders.


### Running Interoperability Tests
**Objective**:
To execute and validate the defined interoperability scenarios between Component A and Component B, ensuring they interact as expected, based on the predetermined success metrics.

**Steps**:

1. **Preparation**:
   - Ensure that both Component A and Component B are correctly set up in the test environment.
   - Reconfirm that all necessary resources, tools, and configurations are in place.

2. **Select Test Cases**:
   - Based on the previously defined interoperability scenarios, derive specific test cases that will validate each scenario.

3. **Test Execution**:
   - **Initiate the Tests**: Start running the tests based on the defined test cases.
   - **Monitor**: Actively monitor the interaction between Component A and Component B during the test execution. Capture logs, response times, error messages, etc.
   - **Capture Results**: Document the outcomes of each test case, noting successful completions, failures, and any anomalies.

4. **Analyze Test Results**:
   - Review the test outcomes against the predefined success metrics.
   - Identify any patterns or consistent issues that might hint at deeper problems.
   - For any failed tests, pinpoint the cause. Was it a configuration issue? A compatibility problem? A bug in one of the components?

5. **Stakeholder Review**:
   - Present the test results to stakeholders, emphasizing key findings, successful interactions, and areas that need attention or improvement.
   - Gather feedback and recommendations for potential retests or adjustments.

6. **Iterative Testing**:
   - Based on the analysis and stakeholder feedback, adjust configurations, fix identified issues, and re-run failed or problematic tests to confirm resolutions.

7. **Documentation**:
   - Document the entire test process, including test cases, results, analyses, stakeholder feedback, and any corrective actions taken.
   - This documentation provides a clear record for future reference and potential audits.

**Outcome**:
A comprehensive understanding of how Component A and Component B interact in various scenarios, confirmed by systematic testing. Identified areas of seamless operation as well as areas needing adjustment or improvement, backed by concrete test data.

**Process**
- Workshop between component leaders, Prometheus X architects before first test.
- All participants have access to the test sandbox.

### Building Interoperability Sandbox

**Objective**: 
To set up a controlled environment where Component A and Component B can interact, enabling precise testing of their interoperability scenarios without affecting production systems.

**Steps**:

1. **Requirement Gathering**:
   - Identify the technical specifications of the comonents to right
   These are to be provided by docker-compose.yaml with all required dependencies and test data.
   Component dependency images should come from public registries.
   
   - Provide test data in a format easy to import, for example:
        - database dump, easy to import using database system tools
        - a directory to be mounted as a volume in docker-compose.yaml
        - a script to import data in a specific format, to be run before each test 


2. **Resource Allocation**:
   - Resources are allocated on the partner clouds.
   - Services may be accessible publicly for manual testing

3. **Environment Setup**:
   - Install and configure components in the sandbox environment, ensuring they are isolated from production systems.
   - Implement required network configurations, firewall rules, and other essential security measures.

4. **Initial Testing**:
   - Conduct basic tests to ensure components are operational within the sandbox.
   - Validate that they can communicate and interact without any initial, glaring issues.

5. **Stakeholder Review**:
   - Invite relevant stakeholders to review the sandbox setup and gather feedback.
   - Ensure that the environment aligns with the desired test scenarios and success metrics.


**Outcome**: 
A fully functional sandbox environment tailored for testing the interoperability between Components, ensuring accurate and isolated results without risking production systems.

**Process**: 
- Workshop between component test engineers and Prometheus X architects

### Maintaining Interoperability Sandbox

**Objective**: 
To ensure the continued functionality, relevance, and security of the interoperability sandbox over time.
The instance operating the sandbox may be shut down when not in use.

**Steps**:

1. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Continuously monitor the health and performance of both Component A and Component B within the sandbox.
   - Check for issues like resource bottlenecks, unexpected errors, or security vulnerabilities.

2. **Update Management**:
   - After updates, run a set of regression tests to ensure no new interoperability issues have been introduced.

3. **Feedback Loop**:
